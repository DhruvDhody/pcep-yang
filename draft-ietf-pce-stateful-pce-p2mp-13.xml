    <section title="Introduction"
             toc="default">
      <t>As per
      <xref target="RFC4655" />, the Path Computation Element (PCE)
      is an entity that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints. A Path Computation Client (PCC) may make
      requests to a PCE for paths to be computed.</t>
      <t>
      <xref target="RFC4875" /> describes how to set up
      point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched
      Paths (TE LSPs) for use in Multiprotocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. The PCE has
      been identified as a suitable application for the computation
      of paths for P2MP TE LSPs (<xref target="RFC5671"/>).</t>
      <t>The PCEP is designed as a communication protocol between
      PCCs and PCEs for point-to-point (P2P) path computations and
      is defined in
      <xref target="RFC5440" />. The extensions of PCEP to request
      path computation for P2MP TE LSPs are described in
      <xref target="RFC8306" />.</t>
      
      <!--<t>Stateful PCEs are shown to be helpful in many application
      scenarios, in both MPLS and GMPLS networks, as illustrated in
      <xref target='RFC8051'></xref>. These
      scenarios apply equally to P2P and P2MP TE LSPs.
      <xref target='RFC8231'></xref> provides the
      fundamental extensions needed for stateful PCE to support
      general functionality for P2P TE LSP. <xref target='RFC8281'></xref> provides
      the an extensions needed for stateful PCE-initiated
      P2P TE LSP.
      Complementarily, this
      document focuses on the extensions that are necessary in
      order for the deployment of stateful PCEs to support P2MP TE
      LSPs. This document describes the setup, maintenance and
      teardown of PCE-initiated P2MP LSPs under the stateful PCE
      model.</t>-->

      used in

      <section title="Motivation"
               toc="default">
        <t>
        <xref target='RFC8051'>
        </xref> presents several use cases, demonstrating scenarios
        that benefit from the deployment of a stateful PCE
        including optimization, recovery, etc., which are equally
        applicable to P2MP TE LSPs.
        <xref target='RFC8231'></xref> defines the
        extensions to PCEP for P2P TE LSPs. This document complements the previous work by focusing on
   extensions that are necessary in order for the deployment of stateful
   PCEs to support P2MP TE LSPs.</t>
        <t>In addition to that, the stateful nature of a PCE
        simplifies the information conveyed in PCEP messages since
        it is possible to refer to the LSPs via a PCEP-specific LSP identifier (PLSP-ID)
        (<xref target='RFC8231'></xref>). For P2MP, where the size of message is much larger, this is an added advantage. When using a
   stateless PCE, a request to modify an existing P2MP tree requires
   that all the leaves are presented in the PCEP messages along with all
   the path information.  But when using a stateful PCE, the PCEP
   messages can use a PLSP-ID to represent all information about the LSP
   that has previously been exchanged in PCEP messages, and it is only
   necessary to encode the modifications (such as new or removed leaf
   nodes).  The PLSP-ID provides an index into the LSP-DB at the PCE,
   and identifies the LSP at the PCC.</t>
        <t>In environments where the P2MP TE LSPs
        placement needs to change in response to application
        demands, it is useful to support dynamic creation and tear
        down of P2MP TE LSPs. The ability for a PCE to trigger the
        creation of P2MP TE LSPs on demand can be seamlessly
        integrated into a controller-based network architecture,
        where intelligence in the controller can determine when and
        where to set up paths. Section 3 of
        <xref target='RFC8281'>
        </xref> further describes the motivation behind the
        PCE-Initiation capability, which is equally applicable to
        P2MP TE LSPs.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Objectives"
               toc="default">
        <t>The objectives for the protocol extensions to support
        P2MP TE LSPs for stateful PCE are the same as the objectives
        described in section 3.2 of
        <xref target='RFC8231'></xref>.</t>

         When PCC is a Label Switching Router (LSR), participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS-IS), and PCEs
     are either LSRs or servers also participating in the IGP, an
     effective mechanism for PCE discovery within an IGP routing domain
     consists of utilizing IGP advertisements.  Extensions for the
     advertisement of PCE Discovery Information are defined for OSPF and
     for IS-IS in <xref target="RFC5088"/> and <xref target="RFC5089"/> respectively.</t>

     <t>The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV, defined in <xref target="RFC5089"/>, is an optional sub-
     TLV used to advertise PCE capabilities.  It MAY be present within the
     PCE Discovery (PCED) TLV carried by OSPF or IS-IS.  <xref target="RFC5088"/> and <xref target="RFC5089"/>

             toc="default">
    <t>The stateful operations on P2MP TE LSPs are more
   CPU-intensive and also utilize more bandwidth on wire (in comparison to P2P TE LSPs). 
   If a rogue PCC were able to request unauthorized stateful PCE
   operations then it may be able to mount a DoS attack against
   a PCE, which would disrupt the network and deny service to
   other PCCs. Consequently, it is important that implementations
   conform to the relevant security requirements of
   <xref target="RFC5440"/>, <xref target="RFC8306"/> and
   <xref target='RFC8231'></xref>, and
   <xref target='RFC8281'></xref>. 
   Securing the PCEP session using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8253"/>, as per the recommendations
   and best current practices in <xref target="RFC7525"/>, is RECOMMENDED.
   </t>
           <!--<t> As stated in <xref target="RFC6952"/>, PCEP implementations SHOULD support the
   TCP-AO <xref target="RFC5925"/> and not use TCP MD5 because of TCP MD5's known
   vulnerabilities and weakness. PCEP also support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      <xref target="RFC8253"/> as per the recommendations and best current practices
      in <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>-->
